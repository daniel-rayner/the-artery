### Factor V Leiden:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p> First described in 1993 by Dählback et al., factor V Leiden (FVL) is a common autosomal codominant thrombophilia characterized by poor anticoagulant response due to specific mutations in the <i>F5</i> gene which cause activated protein C (APC) resistance.<sup>1,2,3</sup> APC is an endogenous anticoagulant protein which, alongside protein S, typically cleaves and inhibits factors Va and VIIIa (two procoagulant factors, thereby inhibiting further thrombin generation.<sup>4</sup> FVL is the most common hereditary predisposition to venous thrombosis, accounting for roughly 40-50% of familial thrombophilia cases.<sup>5</sup> The prevalence of FVL varies by population, with heterozygosity rates estimated to be 3-8% within those with European ancestry. Meanwhile, homozygosity rates are much lower than heterozygosity rates, and are estimated to be 1/5,000 in Caucasian populations.<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p>There are no clinical features specific to FVL, making its clinical expression quite variable.<sup>3</sup> Many individuals with FVL will never experience a thrombotic event, however, the disease still predisposes them to thrombosis. Various studies suggest that the risk of venous thrombosis is 3- to 7-fold in heterozygous FVL patients, and 80-fold in homozygotes compared to healthy individuals.<sup>6,7</sup> This risk of thrombosis is further modified by other environmental or genetic factors, including pregnancy, protein S deficiency, increasing age, hyperhomocysteinemia, and oral contraceptive use.<sup>2</sup> Despite the increased risk, heterozygosity for FVL has not been associated with increased mortality or a reduction in normal life expectancy.<sup>8,9</sup></p></div>

### A Closer Look Into _F5_:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Located at chromosome 1q24.2, <i>F5</i> encodes the factor V protein, which when activated (factor Va), plays a vital role in amplification of the coagulation casacde.<sup>4,10</sup></p>

<p>Typically, APC inhibits factor Va by cleaving conserved arginine (R) residues, specifically R306, R506, and R679. However, in FVL, there is a missense mutation (c.1691G>A) in <i>F5</i>, causing R506 to be replaced with a glutamine residue (R506Q). This point mutation increases factor Va’s resistance towards being degraded by APC, thereby increasing one’s risk for venous thrombosis.<sup>11</sup></p></div>

    <figcaption>The anticoagulant effect exerted by the APC system. Thrombomodulin (TM) is able to activate protein C, which subsequently binds to protein S (PS) and inactivates factor Va and factor VIIIa. Note how inhibition of factor Va is reduced when Leiden V mutations are present.<sup>12</sup></figcaption>

### Treatment:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Ultimately, as FVL provides a genetic predisposition to thrombosis, it is the thrombotic events which are managed, the majority of which being venous thromboembolisms (VTEs).<sup>13</sup> However, as data is still lacking to support altering treatment for individuals who had a single occurrence of VTE with or without FVL, as well as the fact that FVL patients only have a minimal increased risk of recurrent VTE compared with to general population, experts suggest that VTE management in FVL patients should align with the guidelines for the general population—where patient history plays a major role in the treatment approach. Specifically, VTEs not provoked by typical risk factors (e.g., surgery, prolonged immobilization, trauma) are traditionally given indefinite anticoagulation therapies, while provoked VTEs only justify finite anticoagulant therapy.<sup>14</sup></p></div>
