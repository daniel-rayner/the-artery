### Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p> Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant vascular malformation disorder characterized by telangiectases and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in specific locations.<sup>1,2</sup> AVMs are direct connections between arteries and veins, lacking intervening capillaries, and typically develop in the liver, brain, and lungs. Meanwhile, smaller AVMs—called telangiectases—are most evident on the lips, tongue, face, and fingers, as well as the gastrointestinal (GI), buccal, and nasal mucosa.3 Both AVMs and telangiectases are prone to rupture and hemorrhage, with the severity depending on the location.<sup>3,4</sup> Depending on the region, the prevalence of HHT is estimated to range between 1/5,000 and 1/8,000, classifying it as a rare disease.<sup>1</sup></p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>HHT displays age-related penetrance, with increasing manifestations of symptoms occurring over a lifespan.<sup>3</sup> By age 16, roughly 70% of individuals have some features of HHT, and 90% by the age of 40.<sup>4</sup> The most frequent complication is recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds), with roughly 50% of HHT patients experiencing them by the age of 10, and increasing up to 95% with age. The severity of these nosebleeds varies, ranging from 3-6 minute-long nosebleeds a year to multiple lengthy nosebleeds a day.<sup>2</sup> Visible telangiectases of the skin and buccal mucosa begin to appear in the third decade of life in roughly 90% of cases, and increase in frequency with age. Additionally, recurrent GI hemorrhage occurs in roughly 15-20% of individuals, and peaks in the sixth decade of life.<sup>1,6</sup></p>

<p>Major complications of HHT include stroke (ischemic from pulmonary AVMs; haemorrhagic from cerebral AVMs), severe anemia (from recurrent nasal and GI bleeds), deep vein thrombosis, and in more rare cases, pulmonary hypertension, spinovascular accidents, and liver disease requiring transplantation.<sup>6</sup></p></div>

### The Genetics of HHT:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Currently, there are three major genes in which their mutations have been linked to HHT: <i>ENG</i>, <i>ACVRL1</i>, and <i>MADH4</i>. <i>ENG</i> mutations are the most common and cause type 1 HHT, which accounts for 61% of HHT cases. Meanwhile, mutations in <i>ACVRL1</i> lead to type 2 HHT, accounting for 37% of all cases. Finally, a much rarer (2%) form of HHT combined with juvenile polyposis has been linked to mutations in <i>MADH4</i>.<sup>1</sup></p></div>

### A Closer Look Into _ENG_ & _ACVRL1_:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Found at chromosome 9q34.11, <i>ENG</i> codes for endoglin, a homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed predominantly on endothelial cells, syncytiotrophoblasts, activated monocytes, and tissue macrophages.<sup>3,8</sup> Endoglin plays a role in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway, particularly, by associating with different signaling receptors and modifying TGFβ1 signaling.<sup>3</sup> Meanwhile, <i>ACVRL1</i> (chromosomal location, 12q13.13) encodes activin A receptor type II-like 1 (ACVRL1), a cell-surface receptor for TGFβ ligands, and is predominantly expressed on endothelial, lung, and placental cells.<sup>3,8</sup></p></div>

    <figcaption>An overview of the TGFβ signaling pathway. In vascular endothelial cells, endoglin is able to bind to activin A receptors, which eventually stimulates the expression of genes involved with cell proliferation and adhesion.<sup>7</sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>TGFβ signaling is vital for regulating many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Endoglin and ACVRL1 have been shown to be vital for the development and maintenance of arteriovenous identity, through the coordination of smooth muscle cell recruitment work in unison to regulate cellular proliferation and adhesion.<sup>3,9</sup> However, despite our current knowledge on the TGFβ1 signalling pathway, the exact contributions of <i>ENG</i> and <i>ACRVL1</i> mutations towards the pathogenesis of HHT remain to be elucidated.<sup>3</sup></p></div>

### Treatment:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>At the moment, there are currently no successful treatments allowing for the reverting of telangiectases and AVMs into normal vasculature—current therapies only target the signs and symptoms of HHT.<sup>10,11</sup> Typical treatment for recurrent nosebleeds include surgical nasal packing, administration of angiogenesis inhibitors, or maintenance of the nasal mucosa through air humidification and regular application of lubricants. Additionally, HHT patients are frequently screened for GI hemorrhage, as well as cerebral, pulmonary, and hepatic AVMs.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p>While treatment may be limited as of now, in the future, with more endoglin/ACVRL1 functional studies and a better understanding of HHT pathogenesis, promising therapeutic approaches are sure to arise.</p></div>
