### CADASIL Overview:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p> Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary small-vessel angiopathy which typically manifests in middle-aged adults and is caused by mutations in the <i>NOTCH3</i> gene.<sup>1,2</sup> Due to the increasing availability of diagnostic expertise and genetic testing, the number of identified CADASIL cases has been gradually increasing, with recent estimates suggesting a minimum prevalence rate between 2/100,000 and 5/100,000.<sup>3,4</sup></p></div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>On a cellular level, CADASIL exhibits degeneration of the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within the tunica media, a thickening of the vessel walls in small vessels, and a narrowing of the lumen. These alterations cause relatively symmetrical white matter changes, microbleeds, dilated perivascular spaces, lacunar ischemic infarcts and subcortical and cortical atrophy.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>The clinical presentation of CADASIL often varies between patients, however, the pathology typically presents with four key symptoms: recurrent ischemic strokes, cognitive decline, psychiatric disturbances, and migraine with aura.<sup>2</sup> Transient ischemic attacks and infarctions are the most common symptom in CADASIL, occurring in 60-85% of symptomatic patients.<sup>6</sup> The second most frequent symptom is cognitive impairment, which occurs in 60% of cases. This impairment becomes clinically detectable at age 35-50 and progressively worsens with recurrent strokes and aging.<sup>7</sup> Psychiatric disturbances appear in 25-30% of affected subjects, and are typically in the form of depression, bipolar disorders, apathy, or schizophrenia.<sup>6.8,9</sup> Finally, migraine with aura occurs in 20-40% individuals, however, frequency of attacks varies among cases.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>Despite the large variability between CADASIL cases, all individuals progress until disability and dementia. By the age of 58, >50% of CADASIL patients are unable to walk, and by age 65, roughly 65% of individuals require individual care and cannot attend to their own bodily needs.<sup>2,10</sup> Life expectancy is significantly reduced in CADASIL patients, with a mean age at death of 64.4 years in men and 70.7 years in women.<sup>4</sup></p></div>

### A Closer Look Into <i>NOTCH3</i>:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Found at chromosome 19p13.2, <i>NOTCH3</i> codes for a transmembrane receptor primarily expressed on vascular SMCs (VSMCs) of blood vessels and pericytes, and is vital for the normal function and survival of VSMCs.<sup>5,11</sup> The receptor is composed of three domains: an extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (ICD). Binding of ligands to Notch3 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of the ECD, inducing the translocation of the ICD to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of genes involved with VSMCs differentiation, vascular response to injury, and embryogenesis-related vascular development.<sup>2</sup></p>

(A) The Notch ligand-receptor interactions stimulate the liberation of the Notch intracellular domain, which alongside MAML/CSL, regulates the expression of downstream genes. (B) CADASIL-causing cysteine-altering mutations and mutations from the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC) database, as well as potential cysteine-sparing mutations.<sup>5</sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The majority of CADASIL-causing mutations involve either the loss or gain of a cysteine residue in one of the 34 epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the ECD. These unpaired cysteine residues are thought to disrupt disulfide bridges and cause subsequent receptor misfolding.<sup>2,5</sup> Moreover, Takahashi et al. demonstrated that these mutant Notch3 receptors are highly resistant to degradation compared to wild-type receptors, causing them to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum.<sup>12</sup> Ultimately, while the exact contributions of <i>NOTCH3</i> mutations CADASIL are unknown, researchers hypothesize that their pathogenic effects are caused by their resistance to degradation and their aggregate-prone property, which reduces normal cell function and causes cell degeneration.<sup>13</sup></p>

### Treatment:
<div style="text-align: justify"><p>As of now, there are no successful therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CADASIL progression—patients are only given symptomatic treatments.<sup>2</sup> Acute stroke care typically involves administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator if the required criteria for its use is met. Meanwhile, endovascular recanalization is unlikely to be useful, as CADASIL is a small-vessel angiopathy.<sup>14</sup> Secondary prevention involves standard cardiovascular risk reduction strategies, including limiting alcohol consumption and smoking, controlling weight, undergoing regular physical activity, maintaining a balanced diet, and monitoring blood cholesterol levels.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>While treatment may currently be limited, the discovery that CADASIL is likely caused by cysteine-altering mutations has sparked research towards targeting this relationship. For example, in 2016, Rutten et al. proposed a novel therapy based on cysteine corrective exon skipping, which prevents the inclusion of mutated exons in the mature mRNA product.<sup>15</sup> With further genetic and functional studies, even more promising therapeutic approaches are sure to arise.</p></div>
