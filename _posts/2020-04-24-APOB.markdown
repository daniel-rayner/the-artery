### Familial Hypobetalipoproteinemia:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>First described 1979 by Steinberg et al., familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is an autosomal codominant metabolic disorder predominantly caused by mutations in the <i>APOB</i> gene, and is characterized by apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels less than 5th percentile and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between 20-50 mg/dL.<sup>1,2</sup> The prevalence of FHBL in its heterozygous form is estimated to be between 1/1,000 and 1/3,000, with homozygotes being much rarer.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Interestingly, among 839 adult patients hospitalized in the psychiatrics department at Nantes University Hospital, the prevalence of FHBL was four times higher (20 cases, 2.39% prevalence) than the prevalence within a population of healthy controls (0.57%). Moreover, these FHBL patients indicated a higher prevalence of schizophrenia and hetero-aggressive behaviors compared to control patients. Ultimately, both of these results suggest a link between the genetic etiology of psychiatric disorders and low LDL-C levels.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>The severity of FHBL’s phenotype is heavily dependent on the number of defective <i>APOB</i> alleles, as heterozygotes often have few manifestations outside of an increased risk of fatty liver disease and low apoB-containing lipoprotein levels in the serum.<sup>4,5</sup> Additionally, it is hypothesized that having these low levels of atherogenic lipoproteins may yield the individual cardiovascular protection.<sup>6</sup> Meanwhile, homozygotes present with clinical symptoms including fat malabsorption, neurologic symptoms, retinitis pigmentosa, red cell acanthocytosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.<sup>4</sup> These clinical manifestations are often indistinguishable from those of abetalipoproteinemia, another metabolic disorder caused by mutations in <i>MTTP</i>, which codes for a triglyceride transfer protein.<sup>4,7</sup></p></div>

### An In-Depth Look Into <i>APOB</i>:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>Found at chromosome 2p24-p23, <i>APOB</i> typically encodes two isoforms of apoB in plasma, apoB-100 and apoB-48. ApoB-100 is produced in the liver and is vital to the structure of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL, which transport triglycerides and cholesterol from the liver to tissues, respectively. Meanwhile, chylomicrons containing apoB-48 are synthesized in the intestines in response to dietary fats. ApoB-48 differs from apoB-100, as it contains the amino terminal 48% of apoB-100, and is produced by a premature stop codon at the apoB-100 by mRNA processing in the intestine.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>More than 60 different mutations causing the truncation of apoB, ranging from apoB-2 to apoB-89, have been linked to FHBL.<sup>8</sup> Similar to apoB-48, these truncations are named based on the percentage of the amino terminal at which they truncate (e.g., apoB-55 corresponds to the amino terminal 55% of apoB-100).<sup>9</sup> These truncated forms of apoB have a lower production rate and higher clearance rate, ultimately resulting in low plasma levels of apoB and the lipoproteins they form.<sup>4</sup></p></div>

### Treatment:

<div style="text-align: justify"><p>As the main adverse clinical manifestations of heterozygous FHBL are mild elevation of liver enzymes and development of hepatic steatosis, management typically involves frequent blood tests and monitoring of diet.<sup>2</sup> Specifically, FHBL patients are recommended to take vitamin supplements (vitamins A, D, E, and K) as well as consuming a diet in low fat and reduced long-chain fatty acids.<sup>11</sup></p></div>
