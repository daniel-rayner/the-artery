Launched in April 2020, The Artery is a blog dedicated to highlighting the genetic components of various cardiovascular pathologies that I find interesting! I've been quite intrigued with genetics since my first year of university, and I'm super interested in diving deeper and exploring the vast field of medical genetics.

Currently, I'm hoping to post at least one article a week, so stay tuned! Feel free to email me any suggestions or ideas that you would like to see implemented!

{: DISCLAIMER: The posts on this blog only briefly review the genetics of various pathologies and are not completely comprehensive. I encourage any readers to check out the journal articles cited for more detailed information! .notice--danger}
